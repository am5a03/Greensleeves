Syria crisis: Ceasefire pressure grows over peace plan
The UN Security Council has urged Syria to implement "urgently and visibly" a peace plan requiring a 10 April deadline for ending a military offensive against the opposition.
Envoy Kofi Annan's plan calls for Damascus to pull back troops and heavy weaponry by that date, and for a full ceasefire by 48 hours later.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the conflict was getting worse. Mr Annan urged both sides to seize the moment and end the violence.
"Let us stop the killing and start a serious political dialogue," he told the UN General Assembly. He said he expected a full ceasefire to take effect by 06:00 (03:00 GMT) on 12 April.
Syria has agreed to the plan, but its UN ambassador said that the main threat to the ceasefire came from the armed opposition backed by Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
